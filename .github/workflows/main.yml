# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Install NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2-beta
        with:
          node-version: 12
          
      # Install Yarn
      - uses: borales/actions-yarn@v2.0.0
        with:
          cmd: install # will run `yarn install` command
          
      # Build React App with Yarn
      - name: Build React App
        run: yarn build
      
      #Install Surge
